- Learn general basic programming syntax as applied to Javascript
- **Competencies**: 
  - <kbd>variables</kbd>
  - <kbd>strings</kbd>
  - <kbd>simple maths</kbd>
  - <kbd>if, else</kbd>

## Step 1 : Variables

1. Define a variable, "name"
2. Show this variable in an alert box
3. Commit

## Step 2 : Variables 2

1. Define three variables: `name`, `surname` and `city`.
2. Show them like in the ![](Step_2.png)
3. Commit!

## Step 3 : Strings concatenation

1. Show a dialog box asking the user for his name
2. Show an alert box saying "Hello, ", then the name provided
3. Commit!

## Step 4Â : Strings concatenation 2

1. Just like Step 3, but ask for name, surname, and city (Step 2 + Step 3)
2. Commit  

## Step 5 : Simple Math

1. Ask for the user for two numbers
2. Multiply them
3. Show the result to the user
4. Commit  

## Step 6 : External files and Simple Math

1. Create a separate javascript file
2. Include it in the html
3. Have the user provide two numbers
4. Divide them
5. Show the user the remainder of the division
6. Commit  

## Step 7 : Multiple operations

1. In an external file:
2. Ask the user for his shoe size and his birth year
3. Create a function that:
  1. Multiplies the shoe size by 2
  2. Adds 5
  3. Multiplies by 50
  4. Subtracts the birth year
  5. Adds 1766
4. Shows the result to the user  
5. Commit  

## Step 8 : if, else

1. Ask the user for their age
2. If the user is over 18, show "you are over 18", else, show them "you are under 18"
3. Commit
