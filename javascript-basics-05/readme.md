- **Competencies**:
  - <kdb>JS</kdb>
  - <kdb>Logic</kdb>

## Instructions

- For each of the below problems, create a **problemX.html** file where X is the number of the problem
- In each problem, you should take the input of the user using an **input field** and give output using **script**

### Problems

1. Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name. Commit "greetings" ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘<br>
Example input: Omar <br>
Example output: Hello Omar<br><br>

2. Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names. Commit "condition" ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ <br>
Example input 1 : Omar<br>
Example output 1 : Hello Stranger<br>
Example input 2: Alice<br>
Example output 2: Hello Alice<br><br>

3. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n. Commit "loop" ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘<br>
Example input: 5<br>
Example output: 15<br><br>

4. Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 
10, 12, 15 for n=17. Commit "multiples" ðŸ”‘<br>
Example input: 5<br>
Example output: 8<br><br>

5. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,â€¦,n. Commit "sum or product" ðŸ”‘<br>
Example input 1: 5 +<br>
Example output 1: 15<br>
Example input 2: 5 x<br>
Example output 2: 120<br><br>

6. Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12. Commit "multiplication table" ðŸ”‘<br>
Example output:<br>
1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 <br>
2: 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24<br> 
3: 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 <br>
4: 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 <br>
5: 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 <br>
6: 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72 <br>
7: 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84 <br>
8: 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 88 96 <br>
9: 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 99 108 <br>
10: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 <br>
11: 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 110 121 132 <br>
12: 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120 132 144 <br><br>

7. Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 2 and 30. Commit "prime numbers" ðŸ”‘<br>
Example output: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29<br><br>

8. Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number that is randomely found by your program (between 1 and 100). After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries (8) needed should be printed. I counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘<br>
Example input: 90
Example output: too large trial 1/8
Example input: 20
Example output: too small trial 2/8
Example input: 50
Example output: too large trial 3/8
Example input: 40
Example output: too small trial 4/8
Example input: 45
Example output: Correct with 5 trials!
